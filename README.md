# amazon-account
# This application was created to make user-input flexible
# Created a version of an Amazon user experience
# Designed and developed a Ruby CLI application that uses e-commerce through an internet retailer
# Created 4 categories the user can choose to buy from with the price; food, electronic, toys, and clothing
# In each department there are choices the user can choose to buy including dairy, meats, and carbs under the food department
# For every choice picked, the amount is stored into the cart
# After a choice picked the user will be asked whether they still want to shop or not
# Once the user chooses to stop shopping their total for all the items picked will be stored in the total balance
